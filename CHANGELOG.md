## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-29

### 🔧 Refactoring & Infrastructure Improvements

- **Modularized Setup Infrastructure**:
  - Centralized common functions in `setup/common.sh` (9 reusable functions)
  - Split setup into 15 modular stages (5 preconditions + 5 setup + 5 tests)
  - Eliminated all code duplication across setup scripts
  - 60% reduction in setup.sh size (from 436 to 76 lines)

- **Dynamic Stage Discovery**:
  - Setup stages automatically discovered at runtime from `setup/` directory
  - Numerical sorting ensures correct execution order
  - Add new stages without modifying setup.sh
  - Each stage independent and reusable

- **Setup Orchestrator Pattern**:
  - Replaced monolithic setup.sh with slim orchestrator
  - Complex logic moved to individual `setup/*` stage scripts
  - User confirmation flow and dynamic config extraction
  - Added `setup/99-final-test.sh` for comprehensive verification

- **API Routes Refactoring**:
  - Split monolithic `routes.py` into modular domain-based structure
  - Separate modules: clients, health, internet, network, txpower
  - Improved maintainability and testability

- **Make Scripts Executable**:
  - Ensured all setup.sh and uninstall.sh scripts have execute permissions
  - Improved CI/CD pipeline compatibility

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fix Homepage Test**: Updated to use GET request for reliable HTTP detection
- **Prevent Duplicate iptables Rules**: Enhanced rule creation logic to prevent duplicates
- **Fix Gateway Assignment**: Corrected gateway assignment logic
- **Fix Client Count Reporting**: Fixed reported number of connected clients calculation
- **Test Hardware Independence**: Made tests hardware-independent for better CI/CD compatibility
- **Improve NAT Test Mocks**: Enhanced mocks in `test_enable_nat_auto_upstream` to distinguish between commands
- **Extract Docker IMAGE_NAME**: Improved DRY principle by extracting `IMAGE_NAME` from `deploy_frontend.sh` in uninstall script

### 📖 Documentation & Configuration

- **API Documentation**: Added HTTP status codes to Swagger/OpenAPI responses
- **Configuration Management**: Improved config.yaml handling with example file
- **Development Guidelines**: Updated copilot instructions for development best practices
- **Service Naming**: Renamed service from `wilab.service` to `wi-lab.service` for consistency

### 🔐 Security & CORS

- **CORS Support**: Enhanced frontend integration with proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration
- **Allowed Origins**: Updated configuration for cross-domain requests between frontend and backend
